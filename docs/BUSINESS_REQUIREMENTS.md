# Payment Analysis — Business Requirements

Business context, use cases, and how each component accelerates payment approval rates. For architecture and technical details see [Technical Solution](TECHNICAL_SOLUTION.md); for deploy and configuration see [Reference Guide](REFERENCE_GUIDE.md).

---

## 1. Business overview

**Primary goal:** Accelerate payment approval rates and reduce lost revenue from false declines, suboptimal routing, and missed retry opportunities.

**Approach:** Real-time ML (4 HistGradientBoosting models with 14 engineered features), closed-loop decisioning with parallel enrichment, streaming features, a ResponsesAgent (MLflow, 10 UC tools + python_exec) with write-back capabilities, and actionable analytics so every decision (auth, retry, routing) is data-driven, continuously improving, and consistent with business policy.

## 2. Use cases and impact on approval rates

| Use case | What it does | Impact on accelerating approval rates |
|----------|----------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Smart Retry** | Retry logic, timing, cohorts; ML retry model; recovery gap analysis; `v_retry_success_by_reason` gold view | Surfaces recoverable declines with recovery gap per cohort; granular retry success by decline reason and scenario. |
| **Smart Checkout** | 3DS funnel with contextual guidance, service-path performance, Brazil payment links | Balances friction vs risk with threshold-based recommendations on each metric. |
| **Reason codes & declines** | Unified decline taxonomy, inline expert review (Valid/Invalid/Non-Actionable), recovery opportunities | Identifies top decline reasons with direct feedback; Decline Analyst writes recommendations to Lakebase. |
| **Risk & fraud** | Risk tier, fraud score, Risk Assessor agent with write-back tools | Enables risk-based auth; agent proposes config changes to Lakebase. |
| **Routing optimization** | Routing performance, VS top-route boosting, Smart Routing agent, model serving | Routes to best solution using VS approval rates and agent confidence. |
| **Decisioning** | Closed-loop auth/retry/routing; parallel ML + VS + streaming features; outcome recording | Unifies all signals; policies adjust borderline decisions; feedback loop via POST /outcome. |

## 3. Technology map

| Technology | Role | How it accelerates approval rates |
|------------|------|-----------------------------------|
| **Lakeflow (Bronze → Silver → Gold)** | Ingestion and transforms | Clean, timely data for ML and analytics. |
| **Unity Catalog** | Tables, governance, gold views | Single source of truth for KPIs and model inputs. |
| **ML models** (4 HistGradientBoosting, 14 features) | Real-time scores with training-inference parity | Decisions based on predicted likelihood and risk; `_build_ml_features()` ensures exact match. |
| **Rules engine** (Lakebase/Lakehouse) | Configurable business rules + config API | Operators tune without code; config exposed via GET /api/decision/config. |
| **Vector Search** | Similar-transaction lookup + policy integration | VS approval rates adjust borderline risk tiers in policies. |
| **ResponsesAgent** (10 UC tools + python_exec) | Data-driven analytics, recommendations, config proposals | Agent queries UC functions, writes recommendations and proposes config changes to Lakebase. Served as `payment-response-agent`. |
| **3 unified dashboards + 24 gold views + 9 gold DLT tables** | KPIs, funnels, reason codes, retry-by-reason | Visibility into approvals/declines; v_retry_success_by_reason for granular retry analysis. |
| **Streaming features** | Real-time behavioral features | approval_rate_5m, txn_velocity_1m feed into authentication decisions. |
| **FastAPI + React app** | Closed-loop decision API and actionable control panel | Preset scenarios, inline expert review, recovery gap, top-3 actions, 90% target lines. |
| **Outcome feedback loop** | POST /api/decision/outcome | Records actual outcomes; system continuously improves. |
| **Dual-write sync** | Approval rules synced between Lakebase and Lakehouse | Rules changes in the UI propagate to agents (and vice versa) via BackgroundTasks. |

**High-level flow:** Simulator or real pipelines → Lakeflow → Unity Catalog → Intelligence (ML + rules + Vector Search + AI agents) → Application (FastAPI backend + React UI).

## 4. Component-by-component impact

| Component | What it is | How it accelerates approval rates |
|-----------|------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Medallion (Bronze → Silver → Gold)** | Lakeflow pipelines, 24 gold SQL views, and 9 gold DLT tables: `payments_raw_bronze`, `merchants_dim_bronze` (100 merchants, 8 segments), `payments_enriched_silver`, gold views (KPIs, trends, reason codes, retry performance, `v_retry_success_by_reason`). | Provides clean, timely data so ML models, rules, and dashboards see accurate patterns; `v_retry_success_by_reason` enables granular retry analysis by decline reason and scenario. |
| **Unity Catalog & Lakehouse** | Catalog/schema, volumes, `app_config`, gold views, and (optionally) rules/recommendations in Delta tables. | Single source of truth for catalog/schema and config; gold views feed dashboards and agents; rules and recommendations drive approve/decline/retry behavior. |
| **Lakebase (Postgres)** | Managed Postgres for `app_config`, `approval_rules`, `app_settings`, `online_features`, experiments, incidents. | Stores business rules and config that ML and agents read; experiments support A/B tests (e.g. 3DS strategy); operators tune rules without code to approve more good transactions and block more fraud. |
| **Rules engine (approval rules)** | Configurable rules (conditions + actions) from Lakebase or Lakehouse; exposed via `/api/rules`. **Dual-write:** changes sync between Lakebase and Lakehouse via BackgroundTasks so both the UI and agents see the same rules. | Lets operators define when to approve, decline, or retry; ML and agents use these rules so every decision is consistent with policy and optimized for approval rate vs risk. |
| **ML models (4)** | HistGradientBoosting with 14 engineered features (temporal, merchant/solution approval rates, network encoding, risk-amount interaction) — trained on `payments_enriched_silver`, registered in Unity Catalog, served via model serving endpoints. `_build_ml_features()` ensures training-inference feature parity. | **Approval propensity:** predicts likelihood of approval. **Risk:** enables risk-based auth. **Routing:** picks the solution maximizing approval for the segment. **Retry:** predicts retry success and timing. |
| **Decisioning API** | Closed-loop endpoints (`/api/decision/authentication`, `/retry`, `/routing`, `/outcome`, `/config`) powered by `DecisionEngine`: parallel ML + VS enrichment (`asyncio.gather`), streaming real-time features (approval_rate_5m, txn_velocity_1m), Lakebase config, rule evaluation, thread-safe caching (`threading.Lock`). Policies use VS approval rates and agent confidence to adjust borderline decisions. POST `/outcome` records actual outcomes. GET `/config` exposes current thresholds. | Single decision layer with continuous improvement; parallel enrichment for production performance; outcome feedback loop ensures the system learns from every decision. Falls back to pure-policy heuristics when Lakebase/ML is unavailable. |
| **Vector Search** | Delta-sync index `similar_transactions_index` on `transaction_summaries_for_search`; similar-case lookup via `VECTOR_SEARCH()` TVF. | Powers "similar cases" recommendations; feeds recommendations into the Decisioning UI and agents to suggest actions that accelerate approvals. |
| **ResponsesAgent + Agent Framework** | **ResponsesAgent** (`payment-response-agent`): MLflow ResponsesAgent with 10 UC tools (5 consolidated + 5 operational) + `python_exec`; primary AI Chat backend. **Agent Framework** (Job 6 fallback): custom Python orchestrator + 5 specialists with write-back tools. 17 individual UC functions + 5 consolidated. 4 ML + 1 agent endpoint. | Answer questions with live data; suggest and write routing, retry, and rule changes; propose config changes that operators review from the UI. |
| **3 unified dashboards** | Data & Quality, ML & Optimization, Executive & Trends in Databricks AI/BI (Lakeview). Embeddable in the app via `/embed/dashboardsv3/` path. | Give visibility into approval rates, decline reasons, solution performance, and recovery; operators see where to act and track impact. |
| **FastAPI + React app** | 16-page control panel with actionable UI: Command Center (top-3 actions, 90% target lines, last-updated), Smart Checkout (contextual guidance), Decisioning (preset scenarios, actionable recommendations with "Create Rule"/"Apply to Context"), Reason Codes (inline expert review: Valid/Invalid/Non-Actionable), Smart Retry (recovery gap analysis). All routes have `ErrorBoundary` wrappers, `Suspense` on root `Outlet` for lazy-loaded routes, auth loading state, error retry fallbacks, and `glass-card` styling. | One place to operate the full stack with every data point telling operators what to do next. |
| **Genie** | Natural-language "Ask Data" in the workspace, synced with sample questions (approval rate, trends, segments). | Extends visibility: ask questions in the lakehouse context, supporting the same goal of accelerating approval rates. |
| **Experiments & incidents** | A/B experiments (e.g. 3DS treatment vs control) and incident/remediation tracking in Lakebase. | Experiments measure impact of policy changes on approval rate; incidents track production issues that might hurt approvals so they can be fixed. |

## 5. Payment services context (Getnet)

Payment transactions can use several services (Antifraud, Vault, 3DS, Data Only, Recurrence, Network Token, IdPay, Passkey, Click to Pay). **Smart Checkout**, **Reason Codes**, and **Smart Retry** rely on a shared data foundation: medallion pipelines, gold views, and a single control panel. **Brazil** accounts for most volume; the platform supports catalog/schema and country filters. **Entry systems:** Checkout, PD, WS, SEP; each returns the final response to the merchant. **Smart Retry** covers recurrence and reattempts (e.g. 1M+ such transactions per month in Brazil). **False Insights** is a quality metric (insights marked invalid by specialists) to balance speed vs accuracy.

### Business requirement → Solution

| Business need | Solution |
|---------------|----------|
| Data foundation | Medallion + gold views |
| Unified decline visibility | Reason Codes, decline dashboards, Decline Analyst agent |
| Smart Checkout (Brazil) | Smart Checkout UI, 3DS funnel, Smart Routing |
| Smart Retry | Retry UI, retry analysis, decisioning API |
| Actionable insights | Decisioning API, ResponsesAgent + agent framework, rules engine |
| Feedback loop | Experiments, incidents, rules CRUD, model retraining |
| Single control panel | FastAPI + React app (Setup & Run, Dashboards, Rules, Decisioning, AI Chat) |
| AI-driven intelligence | ResponsesAgent (10 UC tools), Genie |
